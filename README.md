# Project-2-Draft
This is the rough draft of my project about tumor suppressors and their sequence identity as that related to the treatment of mutations within tumor suppressors. All the fasta files are the protein sequences of the tumor suppressors of interest and I am using p53 as my main gene of interest and comparing it to other tumor suppressors. The Project2.RMD is the R-notebook version of my project 2 draft which can be changed while the Project2.html is the web-browsing version for viewing purposes.   
Scientific Question: 
Does the amino acids sequences of the tumor suppressor gene P53 have a sequence identity less than 80% compared to other tumor suppressors which provides the possible explanation of the ineffectiveness of one single drug targeting the tumor suppressor genes?
Scientific Hypothesis:
If the binding site of the tumor suppressor gene p53 amino acids sequence is less than 80% similarity in terms of sequence identity compared to other tumor suppressors with similar functions, then one can see that there is a possible explanation as to why one single therapy targeting tumor suppressor genes are ineffective.
